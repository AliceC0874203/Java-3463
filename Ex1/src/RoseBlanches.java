     * y: 2 y: 1
     *  A wealthy aunt sends you one day a small envelope, with money inside,
     *  to help you finance your studies. You decide to manage this amount as follows:
     * Three quarters of this sum will be dedicated to the purchase of books
     * and supplies The rest will be evenly distributed between:
     * - Caf√©s
     * - subscription to the "Flash computer " journal
     * - subway tickets
     * You also decide to manage this sum in dollars changes. The rest of
     * the money will be going to buy a flower bouquet for your mom for the next Mother's Day.
     * Assuming that a cafe is worth 2 dollars, and a number of "Flash Computer" is worth 4
     * and that a subway ticket is worth 3 dollars, write
     * the RoseBlanches.java program allowing you to produce the following output:
     * How much did you receive money ($)? 800 Book and Supplies: 600 $
     * You can then buy: 66.67
     * 33 coffees  33.33
     * 16 Flash Computer Numbers  16.66
     * 22 subway Tickets 22.22
     * and you will have 4 dollars for the white roses.
     * Indication: use variables of type int.
     * The result of a division of two int will be truncated to an int.
     * Use the % operator that gives you the rest of the entire division.
